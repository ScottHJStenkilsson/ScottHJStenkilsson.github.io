### What is a Cookie and what does it do?

Cookies are messages that web servers pass to your web browser when you visit Internet sites.Your browser stores each message in a 
small file, called cookie.txt . When you request another page from the server, your browser sends the cookie back to the server.

### Why do we use cookies?

It is used by Web Server as an ID that was used to identify YOU from others. It is also used by program(eg. JavaScript) to store a 
temporal data used in the program itself.

### Are cookies secure?

Cookies that are sent over HTTP (port 80) are not secure as the HTTP protocol is not encrypted. Cookies sent over HTTPS (port 443)
are secure as HTTPS is encrypted. So, if Facebook sends/receives cookies via HTTP, they can be stolen and used nefariously. We use
HTTPS, meaning all your data is encrypted and safe.

### Are cookies bad?

No, cookies are stored in txt files which will never cause any trouble to your device.
